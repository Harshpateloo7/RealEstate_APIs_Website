# Real Estate Website
# About
- I have built a web application that provides information on residential properties using the API "https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realty-in-ca1", and another API "https://rapidapi.com/opentripmap/api/places1" which provides information about attractions places by radius in Canada. The website features a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price range, number of bedrooms, and other relevant details. Users can also view a list of attraction places. They will be able to see photos and descriptions of each property, and contact the real estate agent or seller directly through the website.
